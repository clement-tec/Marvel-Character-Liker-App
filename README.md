Marvel Character Liker APP (Name TBD)
App to organize your favorite Marvel characters
As a user;
1. There is a list of Marvel characters on the side of the webpage and you can click on the name and see the details of the character. (Click event)
2. You can click on the like button and add it to your favorite character list. (Click event) (PATCH)
2. There is a form where you can add a new character to the database. (submit event) (POST)
4. Hoping to add the filter function to filter character list (not your favorite list) by alphabet. (Change event)
We will be creating our own db.json file for this project.
